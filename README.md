# Project Description:

This C# console application, serves as a Warehouse Management System. Users can log in using their credentials, with all data stored in JSON format. The system supports various user roles, including supplier, manager, admin, and employee, each with distinct functionalities tailored to their roles within the warehouse environment.

Users can perform operations such as adding, sorting, and removing products, with the system ensuring data integrity through JSON file management. Additionally, the system logs all modifications made to products, maintaining a comprehensive history of changes for each item. This feature allows for tracking and auditing of product alterations over time.

Furthermore, users have the capability to modify product details as needed, ensuring that the warehouse inventory remains accurate and up-to-date. The system provides a user-friendly interface for managing product information, empowering users to make necessary adjustments efficiently.

Moreover, the application offers the functionality to generate reports in various formats, including Excel, PDF, plaintext, and JSON. This feature enables users to extract and visualize data from the system in different formats according to their needs, enhancing the usability and flexibility of the Warehouse Management System.

This project offers a comprehensive solution for managing warehouse operations efficiently within a console-based application framework, facilitating seamless inventory management for businesses while providing versatile reporting capabilities to meet diverse user requirements.
